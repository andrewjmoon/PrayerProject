      The Prayer Project is an accumulation of prayers from saints and holy
      people. The prayerlist page contains a search bar that allows the users to
      search by the saint's first name. There is also a page that provides
      additional information about the saints including feast days and
      Patronage. See the Saint's List page to see the available prayers in
      the Prayer List page.
